# Swagger generated server

Spring Boot Server 


## Overview  
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.  

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)  

Start your server as an simple java application or from the command line using:
```
mvn spring-boot:run 
```

If you want to run under docker (rather than installing maven et al):

```
docker run -it \
	-p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 \
	-v ~/.m2:/root/.m2 \
	-v $PWD:/apps \
	--workdir /apps \
	--expose 8080 \
	maven:latest \
	mvn spring-boot:run 
```

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to  
http://localhost:8080/  

Change default port value in application.properties


Also, the spring code can be read into a project in eclipse by "File->import" then choosing to import "Existing Maven Projects".
Point the import to generated spring-server directory containing the pom.xml file. (Same as eclipse recipe for all the CSC301 individual assignments)
